## Raspberry PI Setup Notes

Notes for getting a Raspberry PI configured for "kiosk" mode -- including starting up a browser in fullscreen to point to webbased dashboard of your choice. 

## Raspberry PI Initial Setup for Kiosk Mode (Dashboard) 

Create a startup script:
```sh
nano /home/pi/startup.sh
```

Recommend file contents: 

```sh
#! /bin/sh
# launch the web page of choice (note update URL as needed) 
sudo -u pi epiphany-browser -a --profile ~/.config http://127.0.0.1/index.html --display=:0 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
sleep 15s;
# this does the same job as pressing the F11 key to force Kiosk mode
xte "key F11" -x:0 &
```

Add script to auto start:
```sh
sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
```
Append the following line
```sh
@/home/pi/startup.sh
```

Optional -- if dashboard server is hosted on PI also add Application start in the startup script.  To get latest source code updates automatically also add GIT updates, and application build step.
